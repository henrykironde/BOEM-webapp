    Welcome to the BOEM Offshore Biodiversity Survey Data Viewer. 
    This application provides tools for visualizing and analyzing biodiversity data collected during aerial surveys of offshore wind energy areas.

    ### Project Overview
    
    This project processes aerial survey data to:
    - Detect and classify marine wildlife species
    - Generate distribution maps and abundance estimates
    - Analyze temporal and spatial patterns
    - Support environmental impact assessments

    The data viewer includes:
    - Interactive maps for viewing survey tracks and observations
    - Analysis tools for exploring species distributions
    - Video playback of flight line footage
    - Image galleries of detected species
